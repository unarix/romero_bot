# Romero Bot

## Who is romero?

Romero was a "piquetero"; a piquetero is a member of a group that has blocked a street with the purpose of demonstrating and calling attention over a particular issue or demand. The word is a neologism in the Spanish of Argentina, coming from piquete (in English, "picket"), that is, its specific meaning as a standing or walking demonstration of protest in a significant spot. 

Romero is a typical troublemaker, and that is why I made a bot in his honor.
